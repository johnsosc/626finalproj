## Introduction - Yellow Green Taxi Data 

Project Scope 
*	My primary focus will be on data collected by the taxi and limousine commission (TLC) of NYC. Specifically, I will analyze yellow and green taxi records from April 2019. 

ETL Process 
1.	Datasets will be transformed from full month data to weekday data only; all other dates will be removed
2.	Datasets will be transformed to morning commute (7-10am) and evening commutes (4-7pm); all other hours will be removed
3.	Erroneous entries will be removed (dates, locations, etc.)

Analysis/Filtering 
*	Analyze average trips/per hour per taxi zone for both morning and evening commutes
*	Analyze average distance per taxi zone for both morning and evening commutes

Questions 
*	How do the yellow and green taxi morning/evening commutes compare by distance? 
*	Do certain zones overlap? Do the zones not overlap? If not, why?
